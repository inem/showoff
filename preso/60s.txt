Git is an open source, distributed version control system 
implemented as a directed acyclic graph of commit objects 
pointing to snapshots of content, 
with all data saved in it's own custom content addressable filesystem 
by the SHA-1 checksum hash of each objects data.  
branches are simply pointers into this directed graph of commits, 
identifying entry points that designate the latest work on that branch, 
allowing Git to traverse the pointers, determining a coherent history.  
this makes branching cheap and easy, 
and merging simple, 
encouraging non-linear development styles 
and frictionless context switching 
while facilitating distributed development, 
cryptographic integrity 
and late decision making.  
nearly all commands run locally with no network latency overhead 
and it is implemented mainly in C, 
making it incredibly fast and efficient even for very large projects.  
There are several large open source projects using it, 
not to mention the 200,000  open source repositories 
maintained by the 175,000 developers on GitHub alone.
